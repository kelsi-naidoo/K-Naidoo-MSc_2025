## üéØ Best Practices

### Data Upload
1. **Format Your Data**: Ensure your CSV/Excel file has the required columns
2. **Clean Your Data**: Remove duplicates and handle missing values before upload
3. **Check Data Types**: Ensure dates are in a recognizable format
4. **Validate File Size**: Large files may take longer to process

### Model Selection
1. **Accuracy First**: Start with the model that has the lowest RMSE
2. **Consider Resources**: Choose models based on your computational constraints
3. **Balance Trade-offs**: Consider the accuracy vs. speed trade-off
4. **Use Performance Data**: Leverage the performance analysis for informed decisions

### Performance Optimization
1. **Speed-Critical**: Use Linear Regression or ARIMA for real-time applications
2. **Memory-Constrained**: Choose ARIMA for limited memory environments
3. **CPU-Limited**: Select XGBoost for moderate CPU usage
4. **Balanced Approach**: Use LSTM for optimal accuracy/compute ratio

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Dashboard Won't Start**:
```bash
# Check if Streamlit is installed
pip install streamlit

# Check if you're in the right directory
ls app.py

# Check configuration
ls config/config.json
```

**No Data Available**:
- Ensure Entity A and B data files exist in the processed data directory
- Run the data cleaning pipeline first: `python notebooks/02_data_cleaning.py`

**No Model Performance Data**:
- Run the forecasting models first: `python notebooks/03_forecasting_models.py`
- Check that performance files exist in the reports directory

**Upload Errors**:
- Verify file format (CSV or Excel)
- Check that required columns are present
- Ensure file is not corrupted or empty

### Error Messages

**"Configuration file not found"**:
- Ensure `config/config.json` exists
- Check file permissions

**"Entity data not found"**:
- Run data cleaning pipeline
- Check file paths in configuration

**"No performance data found"**:
- Run forecasting models
- Check reports directory for output files

## üìä Data Requirements

### Minimum Data Requirements
- **Emissions Column**: Required for all analyses
- **Date Column**: Recommended for time series analysis
- **Source Column**: Optional but useful for detailed analysis

### Recommended Data Structure
```csv

2020-01-01,1000.5,Electricity,Office,Commercial
2020-01-02,1200.3,Natural Gas,Retail,Commercial
...
```

### Data Quality Guidelines
- **No Missing Values**: Handle missing data before upload
- **Consistent Date Format**: Use ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Reasonable Values**: Check for outliers and errors
- **Sufficient History**: At least 12 months of data for forecasting

## Net Zero Pathways Tab

The Net Zero Pathways tab provides:
- A comparison of your current emissions trajectory with SBTi 1.5¬∞C and 2¬∞C science-based target pathways
- An interactive calculator to explore custom reduction rates and target years
- Gap analysis and recommendations

### How to Use
1. **Select the Net Zero Pathways tab** from the sidebar.
2. **Choose your entity** (Entity A or Entity B).
3. **Pick an analysis mode:**
   - *Current Trajectory vs SBTi*: See your current trend overlaid with SBTi pathways, all starting at the same base year and value.
   - *Interactive Calculator*: Use sliders to set your annual reduction rate or target net zero year and see the required pathway.
4. **Interpret the plots:**
   - All lines start at the same base year (default: 2020) and emissions value for fair comparison.
   - If the base year is missing for an entity, the dashboard uses the mean emissions and shows a warning.
5. **Review the gap analysis and recommendations** to understand your alignment with SBTi targets.

### Tips
- If your data is missing the base year, check your processed files or adjust the base year in the code.
- The dashboard is robust to different data structures for Entity A and Entity B.
- All features update live as you interact with the controls.
